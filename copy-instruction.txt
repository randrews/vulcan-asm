Three arguments: dest, src, mode
Mode is a word of three bytes, separated into three one-byte sub-args

The sub-args are:
- High byte: mode arg
- Mid / low bytes are a 16-bit limit arg
- (Some end modes only use the low byte)

Mode arg is three fields: 
- how the src is interpreted / incremented
- how the dest is interpreted / incremented
- how the end of the loop is triggered

src modes: (000000xx)
- src is address, increment (00)
- src is address, decrement (01)
- src is address, constant (10)
- src is literal (11)

dest modes: (0000xx00)
- dest is address, increment (00)
- dest is address, decrement (01)
- dest is address, constant (10)
- dest is ignored, do not copy (11)

end modes: (00xx0000)
- count: treat the limit arg as a 16-bit number, copy at most that many values. (x0)
- sentinel: treat the limit arg as an 8-bit sentinel, copy everything up to (but not including) the sentinel (x1)
- null: copy everything up to (but not including) the first 0 byte (can be combined with the other two, 1x)

So, 00 is count without null term, 10 is count and null term, 01 is sentinel without null term, 11 is sentinel with null term

Return values:
- Mode is consumed
- Both src and dest args are left on the stack...
- But in the state they were in when the end test failed

Examples:
- Copy 16 bytes from 0x1000 to 0x1000:
    push 0x2000
    push 0x1000
    copy 16 ; leaves 0x2010, 0x1010 on the stack; last byte copied was 0x100f
- Copy from 0x1000 to 0x2000 until a null terminator:
    push 0x2000
    push 0x1000
    copy 0x100000 ; can't use null term, because we have to use either sentinel or count with it
    ; Or until a space char (32):
    copy 0x100020
- Find the first 0 after 0x1000 (strlen):
    push 0x1000 ; Don't need a dest since it'll be ignored anyway
    copy 0x1c0000 ; leaves the address of the 0 on the stack
- Clear an array of 64 bytes after 0x1000 (memset)
    push 0x1000
    push 32 ; what we'll clear it to
    copy 0x030040 ; end mode: count w/o null, dest mode: increment, src mode: literal, mode arg: 64
- Copy each byte of a null-termed string to 0x41 (puts):
    push 0x41
    push 0x1000
    copy 0x180000 ; end mode: sentinel w/o null, dest mode: constant, src mode: increment, mode arg: 0
- Find the next space-or-null in a null-terminated string
    push 0x1000 ; Src address of string
    copy 0x3c0020 ; end mode: sentinel w/ null, dest mode: ignore,
